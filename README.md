# Project Overview

This project is a simple quiz application that allows users to register, answer quiz questions, and view their score at the end. Below are the main concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I used in this project:

## HTML Concepts
- **Forms:** Used to capture user registration details such as username, password, first name, last name, and email.
- **Modal:** Implemented a modal dialog for the registration form using Bootstrap's modal component.
- **Structure:** Organized the content using div containers for questions, choices, and user registration.

## CSS Concepts
- **Styling:** Applied custom styles for the body, navbar, modal, form controls, buttons, and radio buttons.
- **Layout:** Used flexbox to center content vertically and horizontally within the container.
- **Color Scheme:** Chose a dark-themed color scheme for the background and accent colors for buttons and interactive elements.

## JavaScript Concepts
- **Event Handling:** Utilized event listeners to handle user interactions such as form submission, next question button clicks, and radio button selections.
- **Data Handling:** Stored user registration data and quiz questions in arrays for processing and tracking.
- **Dynamic Content:** Dynamically generated HTML content for questions and choices based on user interactions.
